Example Usage of python animated_clients.py.txt

python animated_clients.py.txt --indir=./example_input/ --outdir=./example_output/ --header="Header string" --footer="Footer string"

This script is still somewhat fragile and does not yet do all the path 
and file existance checking that it should. To use the example 
invocation you will need to make sure that the indir and outdir 
locations exists.

indir is used to hold file inputs that the script needs.
The example invocation requires that indir holds:
  ips-with-epoch.txt : file with ip clients and epoch timestamp
  glds05ag30.asc  : population density data
  regions.txt : region definitions

indir defaults to ./

if the file saved_data.pickle exists in outdir, this file will be loaded 
in an attempt to create image frames based on previous timestamp 
imformatin stored in the pickle file. This allows you to generate 
additional frames in a sequence without parsing the full ip log on each 
run.  For example, you can run this script daily, using ip client 
information from the end of previous day stored in the pickle file. 
Run in this manner, the script will generate 24 new frames daily using 
only daily ip client logs for each day.


outdir defaults to ./animation-frames/
you must make sure outdir exists.

outdir holds:
  the sequence of generated frame images with prefix frame_
  the pickle file saved_data.pickle, which stores previous frame data
  summary client_per_capita: clientpop_<epoch>.png  
  population density: population_<epoch>.png
  summary of client density: current_<epoch>.png

<epoch> is the most recent epoch associate with a the script.
