"    1. Contributors and Contributions.\n"
"\n"
"       A. The Project and any individual or legal entity that\n"
"       voluntarily submits to the Project a Contribution are\n"
"       collectively addressed herein as \"Contributors\". For legal\n"
"       entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other\n"
"       entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n"
"       control with that entity are considered to be a single\n"
"       Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\"\n"
"       means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction\n"
"       or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise,\n"
"       or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n"
"       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\n"
"       entity.\n"

"       B. A \"Contribution\" is any original work, including any\n"
"       modification or addition to an existing work, that has been\n"

"       products owned or managed by the Project, where such work\n"
"       originates from that particular Contributor or from some entity\n"
"       acting on behalf of that Contributor.\n"
"\n"
"       C. A Contribution is \"submitted\" when any form of electronic,\n"
"       verbal, or written communication is sent to the Project,\n"
"       including but not limited to communication on electronic\n"
"       mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking\n"

"       to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and\n"
"       otherwise transfer your Contribution and derivative works\n"

"    4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above\n"

"       property that you create that includes your Contributions, you\n"
"       represent that you have received permission to make\n"
"       Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer\n"

"       A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n"

"    8. You agree to notify the Project of any facts or circumstances\n"
"       of which you become aware that would make these representations\n"
