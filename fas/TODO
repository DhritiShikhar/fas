Things to Fix in FAS2 before declaring it done


safasprovider.py
----------------
validate_password():
  We'll want to change this to something that allows for longer passwords
  (like md5).  The one thing about that is we have to figure out how system
  passwords use salt, etc.  That way we'll be able to use this with
  make_shell_accounts.

fasClient.py
---------------
Proper logging
